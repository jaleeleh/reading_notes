# NOTES of  Comparison and logical operators and loops
## COMPARISON OPERATORES:the result of the condition is boolean,true or false.
 * is equal to ==
* is not equal to !=
* strict equal to ===
* strict not equal to !==
* greater than >
* less than <
* greater than or equal >=
* less than or equal <=

## LOGICAL OPERATORS:allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operatoes.
* logical AND &&
* logical OR  ||
* logical not !

## LOOPs:loops check the condition if it returns true the code block will run ,then the condition will be checked again if it still returns true the code block will run agin until the condition returns false
 * for loop: if u need to run the code specific number of times
 * while loop:if u dont know the number of times
 * do while: its similar to while but it will always execute the statments inside the{} at least once.
