# From the Duckett HTML book:
## CH1:STRUCTURE
###  in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents.
 and we can structure it by HTML
 * HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled Xbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
 * Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes Xthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
 * Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more Xabout the content of that element.

 ## CH8: EXTARA MARKUP
 * <!Doctype html> 
   each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using 
 * <!-- --> for comment
 * id attributes :Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element.
 * The id attribute is known as aglobal attribute because it  can be used on any element.
 * class attributes:way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
 * block elements:Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.
 * inline elements:Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.
 * The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
 *<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
 * <meta>: element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.

 ## CH18:PROCESS AND DESIGN
 ### important tips for web design
* every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is  inDividual or companies.

* the primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps   users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

# From the Duckett JS book
 ## CH1:The ABC of Programming
 * A script is a series of instructions
 * To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete   that task 
 * java script runs where it is found in the html.
 * If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
