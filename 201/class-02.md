## CH2:TEXT
There is two types of markup:
* Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
* Semantic markup: which provides extra information.
* HTML has six "levels" of headings:<h1>....<h6>
* <p>: a browser will show each paragraph on a new line.
* Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver
usually have two views .the page you are creating: a visual editor and a
code view.

## CH10:CSS INTRO
 * css makes your web pages more attractive,controlling the design of them .
 * CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
 * Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
  the rule applies to) and declarations (that
  indicate what these elements should look like).
  ** there is 3 types of styling webpage: **
 1. external:All of your web pages can share the same style sheet.
 2. internal:in the head tag in the html page
 3. inline:inside the elements.

## CH2:JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS.
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon

* JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE.
* statements are surrounded by curly braces;
these are known as code blocks.
* comments to explain what your code does.
### VARIABLES:
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script

* you have to declare the variable befor using it.

** six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:

1. The name must begin with               
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.

2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words

4. All variables are case sensitive

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.

### ARRAYS:
*  a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

## CH4:DECISIONS AND LOOPS:
* Conditional statements allow your code to make
   decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
