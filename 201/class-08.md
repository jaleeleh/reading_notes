## CH 15:LAYOUTS,css:
 * CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
 * Block-level elementsstart on a new lineExamples include:
```<h1> <p> <ul> <li>```
* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include:
```<img> <b> <i>```
* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
 * CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: 
1. normal flow
2. relative positioning
3. absolute positioning.
* To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
(box offset) properties.
1. Fixed Positioning This is a form of absolute positioning that positions
the element in relation to the browser window
2. Floating Elements Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
