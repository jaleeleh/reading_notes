## CH13:BOXES:css
* we use (hight) and (width) to control the dimensions of  boxes
 * the most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, 
* The (overflow )property: tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
 1. (hidden )This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
 2. (scroll) This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
* Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. padding:Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
2. margin :Margins sit outside the edge of the border.
3. border.

* The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.( visible ,hidden)
* The (box-shadow) property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.
* CSS3 introduces the ability to create rounded corners on any box, using a property called
(border-radius).

## CH4:DISISION AND LOOPS:javascript
* A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the
variable matches that value.
* type coercion: JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to
complete an operation.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
