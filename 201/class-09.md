* Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
**TERMINOLOGY**
1. EVENTS FIRE OR ARE RAISED
When an event has occurred, it is often described as having fired or
been raised. In the diagram on the right, if the user is tapping on a link, a
click event would fire in the browser.
2. EVENTS TRIGGER SCRIPTS
Events are said to t rigger a function or script. When the click event
fires on the element in this diagram, it could trigger a script that enlarges
the selected item.

* Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.

**THE EVENT OBJECT**
When an event occurs, the event object tells
you information about the event, and the
element it happened upon.
