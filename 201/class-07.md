 ## Chapter 6: “Tables”
 * A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.
* ```<table> ``` element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
* ```<tr>```You indicate the start of each row using the opening ```<tr>```tag.
*  Each cell of a table is represented using ``` <td>```
```<th>```
The ```<th>``` element is used just like the ```<td>``` element but its
purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. 

* For long tables you can split the table into a ```<thead>```,
```<tbody>, and <tfoot>```
# From the Duckett JS Book
## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects”
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help  you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
